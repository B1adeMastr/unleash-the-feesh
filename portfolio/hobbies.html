            Having garnered a rather-large amount of experience in life, I have a relatively large group of hobbies over the years.
            <li><a href="yugioh.html">Yugioh:</a> a childhood favorite game and TV series. A hobby I primarily got into overseas</li>
            <li><a href="pokemon.html">Pok&eacute;mon:</a> another childhood favorite that has only grown with me over the years.</li>
            <li><a href="dnd.html">Dungeons &amp; Dragons:</a> a game I was introduced to in High School. I've always enjoyed spending time creating and playing characters with friends.</li>
            <li><a href="music.html">Music:</a> both listening to and playing.</li>
            <li>Computers: my degree focus probably infers this, but I have always enjoyed playing around with computers and such. My desktop PC I built myself upon graduating High School, and I have-since upgraded several of its components over the years.</li>
            <li>Martial Arts: I had obtained the rank of Red II before moving abroad, and performed well at tournaments.</li>
            <li>Reading: a hobby that has gotten me in trouble in the past. The silver lining is hyperfixating on books developed my ability to traverse crowded hallways with purely peripheral vision. Preference for Fantasy and Sci-Fi.</li>
