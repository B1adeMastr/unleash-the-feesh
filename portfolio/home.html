            Hello, my name (obviously) is Colin Beary. I am a Cyber Security Major out of Arapahoe Community College and Colorado State University: Pubelo.<br>
            This site has a twofold use: to demonstrate my capabilities with Web Design &amp; Development, and to give greater insight as-to the person that I am, and my history. <br>
            As such, this site will serve as a resume of sorts, but with greater detail and explanation on my interests and what makes mme who I am, as well as the background I have obtained through experiencing life. <br>
            This will range from experience and education to my hobbies and extracurricular interests.<br>
            <br><br> Welcome to my site.
